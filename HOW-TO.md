# HOW TO integrate PPK-Flutter

## Introduction

`ppk_flutter` is not fully-fledged PDF-Viewer. The PDF-viewing and all other functionality is based
on [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/).

You absolutely, definitely need a license to run this in production environment, unless you are
ok with having "PSPDFKit Trial License" written all over your PDF-pages (joking, even this is
probably not allowed to be distributed as you **absolutely, positively need a license to
distribute your app with PSPDFKit**).

I wrote this plugin because:
- Flutter is becoming more and more widely used and is actually a great framework
- There is no feasible, nice, fully-fledge integration of PSPSFKit for Flutter
- On anything other than iOS/macOS, previewing PDFs is just a f****ng nightmare and the previews look really, really horrible
- ... I happen to start liking PSPDFKit ...*


*: On that, I used PSPDFKit a long time ago once and it was not too bad. I basically like
the small-ish company in Austria that they are. I also convinced at least one of my clients
to license PSPDFKit for their product. Even though, the documentation is sometimes "difficult" and "not clear", it is still probably
the best library out there.

## Integration

TODO :-)
